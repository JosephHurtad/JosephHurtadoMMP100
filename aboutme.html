				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a student at Borough of Manhattan Community College in the Multi-Media Programming Course, I'm fairly new to Programming and&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;Design, even do I have had some previous experience thanks to some project ideas I had back in High School. The first main experience I had with&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;design that motivated me to pursue it in college was in a high school computer design class, the assignment was to create a motherboard design in&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;any way I wanted, however, no one could have the same design as another, so we had to assign design types to each student, I chose to do a 3D&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;design of a motherboard, it was just a crazy idea that came to my mind at the moment but I had no idea how to get started so I asked Google for&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;help, the first thing that came up was this free 3D design software called "Blender" and I was hooked, I downloaded the software at home and&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;started working. A week had passed, the assignment was due and I had just finished rendering my work, the final product was a video of a pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;detailed 3D motherboard made of some sharp shapes spinning around, fully colored and with text showing some main parts of a motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;The video was about 10 seconds long because it took way too long to render anything longer, but I loved it and was proud of it, sadly I lost the&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;video and blender folder in the flash drive I carried around in my pocket along with my keys ;(, but I had so much fun making that project that it&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				<span style="border-style: solid; background-color: grey;">&nbsp;always stuck in my head, even if I hadn't done anything like it since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
